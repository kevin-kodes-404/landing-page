# landing-page
My first landing page using HTML and CSS

This will be an my first attempt at creating a landing page for a fictional coffee shop. 
Goal is to learn to use git and commit often, creating a log of how this page was created and evolved. 
Additionally, I will be using the skills I've learned with HTML and CSS, especially flexbox.
